/**
 * Integration tests cover, as opposed to unit tests, parts of or even the whole system.
 * They can be used to test scenarios of the full working system and complement unit tests.
 * Often, integration tests are more "high level" and tests the overall behaviour of the system.
 *
 * This class contains some usage scenarios and can be a start for designing your implementation.
 * However, you do not need to keep everything the same, you are free to add, remove, and modify classes
 * and interfaces.
