# Exercise 1 Corrections

You solved the exercise by implementing a custom algorithm that passes all 
tests as requested. However, your handling of the star character has some 
problems. I added another class called `FilePatternTestExtended`, which 
contains some tests involving the star that fail with your implementation. You 
do not consider all possible matches for a star in the part where you check 
whether there is a match after an asterisk. Have a look at the exercise 
slides, maybe you can adapt the solution there.

Since you pass all provided tests, you do not have to do anything more and 
your solution is accepted.
